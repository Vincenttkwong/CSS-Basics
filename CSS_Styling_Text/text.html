    <h2 class="article-title">Technological revolution</h2>
    <p class="body">
      Since the beginning of time, the human race has made giant leaps forward
      in the way we live our lives. These big changes are referred to as
      revolutions.
    </p>
    <p class="body">
      Human development has been made possible through the emergence and
      understanding of new technologies. These have gone on to shape
      civilisations for the centuries that followed and even influence the way
      we live our lives today.
